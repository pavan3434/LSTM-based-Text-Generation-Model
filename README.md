# LSTM-based-Text-Generation-Model

Description:

This code implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for generating text based on the content of Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland". The model learns patterns in the text and can generate new, similar text.

Key features of this implementation include:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Loads the text file and converts it to lowercase
   - Creates a mapping between characters and integers for encoding
   - Prepares sequences of 100 characters as input and the next character as output

2. Model Architecture:
   - Uses a Sequential model with two LSTM layers (256 units each)
   - Includes Dropout layers (20% dropout rate) for regularization
   - Ends with a Dense layer using softmax activation for character prediction

3. Training:
   - Compiles the model using categorical crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer
   - Trains for 10 epochs with a batch size of 128
   - Implements ModelCheckpoint to save the best model during training

4. Text Generation:
   - Selects a random seed sequence from the input data
   - Generates 100 new characters based on the learned patterns

This implementation demonstrates advanced natural language processing techniques, showcasing how deep learning can be applied to understand and generate human-like text. It's particularly useful for those interested in creative AI applications, language modeling, or studying the patterns in classic literature through a computational lens.

The model's ability to capture the unique style and vocabulary of "Alice in Wonderland" makes it an interesting tool for literary analysis and AI-assisted creative writing inspired by Carroll's work.
